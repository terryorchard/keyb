# Why this?
Since making the switch to tenkeyless keyboards many years ago, myself and my dad in particular have been missing our numpads for data entry and symbols with alt codes. On top of that we both do af fair bit of repetitive typing that could be moved to macros, so I decided to have a go at making a number + macro pad and ended up making three: one to learn from, one for me, and one for my old man. I have some extra encoders lying around and find them very useful so I threw those in, and put in a single RGB LED for layer indication. I also had seen some copper-only builds floating around that looked awesome, so I wanted a project I could try to do with no soft wires without being overly ambitious.

# How'd it go?
The layout was pretty simple, just a 4x5 grid with the bottom right key moved up to the encoder push. I decided not to go with a standard numpad layout, with the large + and 0 keys just so it'd look more unique and have a few extra keys open for programming and I'm pretty happy with that. The initial CAD was very very simple, but I ended up making a really refined spot for the MCU with hotswap socket slots, and a nice lifted area for the encoder. I printed with 100% infill for a little extra weight and durability, although it was definitely overkill the extra print time and filament was pretty negligible.
The wiring being all copper was a major goal from the start, and was easily my favorite part of the build. I just straightened the wire with a drill + plyers, roughly figured out how much length I'd need for a run, then bent, tested placement, bent, and repeat until it looked like a good fit. Then it was just a matter of heat shrink, tweezers, and patience to get everything soldered in place without any shorts. I'm very very happy with how it came together; it was definitely a lot more work, but not too difficult and overall WAY more aesthetically pleasing. I got some 16 gauge enameled wire for the LED since the pads there are so fine, and it works great... except for the firmware.
The last thing to really finish it up was the 3mm acrylic bottom plate with a new "logo" for my designs, a cat with a wizards hat, from sendcutsend. Super affordable, keeps the wiring protected from being moved or shorted, and makes the whole thing feel really premium and complete.

# What next?
The last thing I need to get figured out is the single RGB LED layer indication. It seems like it "should" be really easy but I just can't get it working after many, many attempts. I'll circle back and update this readme when I finally figure it out. Overall I consider this one a big success and don't plan on doing any revisions or additions besides refining my keymap and other QMK stuff.
